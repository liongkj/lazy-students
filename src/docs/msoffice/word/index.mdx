Tips to use Microsoft Word:

## Pinyin
There is sometimes we need to change the phonetic guide in ms word but the normal CTRL-F (Find) and replace all. But this does not work in the ruby text (the phonetic guide in your own language).

In this tutorial, I will be using China Chinese for example.


1. To be able to find all phonetic guide characters, first we need to convert the document to Field Code with Alt-F9 (MacOs option-F9).

2. Find the Field code of the word you want to change. And copy by clicking Ctrl + C (MacOs CMD+C). For example:

Field code:
>{EQ \* jc0 \* "Font:Noto Sans CJK Jp Regular" \* hps14 \o(\s\up21(*<ins>WRONG PHONETIC</ins>*),*YOUR CHAR*}

3. Then open the search box by clicking the shortcut key CTRL+F.

4. Then paste the original field code inside.

5. Paste the original field code in the "replace with" box one more time  and make the changes accordingly. For example, make your changes to *YOUR RUBY CHAR* to the correct pinyin.

6. Lastly, you can choose to replace all or replace one by one.
